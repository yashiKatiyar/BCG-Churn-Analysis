# BCG Data Science Job Simulation

This repository contains the work completed as part of the **Forage BCG Data Science Job Simulation**. In this simulation, I worked on a **customer churn analysis** project where the objective was to predict which customers are likely to leave a company using historical customer data.

## Project Overview

The simulation allowed me to dive into the real-world application of data science techniques, from data cleaning to building a predictive model and presenting the insights. The project focused on applying machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn using **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

## Key Steps in the Project:

### 1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset by removing missing values and handling outliers.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and relationships within the data.
- Handled categorical variables and normalized numerical data to prepare for modeling.

### 2. Model Development
- Developed a **Random Forest Classifier** model to predict customer churn.
- Optimized the model using **hyperparameter tuning**, achieving an accuracy of **93%**.
- Performed **cross-validation** to ensure robustness and validate model performance.

### 3. Data Visualization & Insights
- Created **data visualizations** to present key insights about customer churn.
- Developed an executive summary with actionable recommendations for improving customer retention based on the findings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in **data wrangling**, **predictive modeling**, and **data visualization**.
- Developed skills in building machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
- Learned how data science can directly impact business decisions, such as improving customer retention strategies.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional models (e.g., **logistic regression**, **XGBoost**) and compare performance.
- Experiment with feature engineering to improve model accuracy further.
## Task 1 
- This was to write a mail to client on how you have understood the problem , establishing requirements and how you plan to solve their issue. If you want to have , it will be provided on request drop a message.
